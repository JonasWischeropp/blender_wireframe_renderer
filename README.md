# Render Wireframe Blender Addon
This addon makes it easy to render the wireframe of a scene with the press of a button.  
It's done by using and extending the technique described [here](https://www.artstation.com/blogs/daustindoodles/GKpw/quick-and-easy-wireframe-renders-in-blender) by D. Austin.

# Setup
1. Download [render_wireframe.py](render_wireframe.py)  
    - Click on [render_wireframe.py](render_wireframe.py)  
    - Click on the three dots above the document on the right side and choose *Download*
2. Install inside Blender  
    - Navigate to Edit > Preferences > Add-ons  
    - Press *Install* and select the downloaded file

# How to Use
The functionality and settings are exposed in the **Render Properties** panel under **Wireframe Renderer**.  
Or for faster access the render can be triggered from the top bar under **Render**.
